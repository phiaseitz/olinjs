## If you're still working on the homework:
- On the board, draw a diagram which represents how an AJAX request works. Make sure you represent the client, the server, get/post requests, responses, data which is passed from client to server and from server to client... and what else?
- On the board, list as many methods for client/server communication as you can and compare/contrast them.
- Selector practice
    + JSfiddles
- AJAX readings
    + a couple of them -- choose your own adventure
- Adding HTML to a page using jQuery
    + JSfiddle
- Populating a database
- Show your group a problem you're trying to solve or a problem you think you solved in a particularly clever way. Get their feedback -- what did they do to solve the same problem? Do they understand things you don't, or vice versa? Do you have different mental models for the same thing?


## If you're already done with the homework:
- Be a peer teacher for the day -- help the people around you with their burger apps. Teaching can be a great way to solidify your own understanding.
